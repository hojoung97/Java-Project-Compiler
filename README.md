# Java-Project-Compiler
Java Project Compiler
This is our project for Object-Oriented Programming course at Purdue University

This is an implementation of an compiler that parses instructions and generates bytecode in binary files (.smp).
Although this project does not have an application to practical problem, it demonstrates a good practice of object-oriented programming (OOP) and showcases fundamental concepts of Java OOP (such as inheritance, polymorphism, function overloading and numerous concept you can think of that is related to OOP)
